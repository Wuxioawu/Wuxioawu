### Hi there 👋, I'm Paul Warren

Backend-focused software engineer interested in distributed systems and AI-powered applications.

I spend most of my time thinking about system design, scalability, reliability, and how large language models can be applied to real-world software. I enjoy building things end-to-end and understanding the trade-offs behind architectural decisions.

This GitHub profile is a place where I document my learning, experiments, and side projects.
